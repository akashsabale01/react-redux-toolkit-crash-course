- Redux Toolkit (also known as "RTK" for short) is our official recommended approach for writing Redux logic. The @reduxjs/toolkit package wraps around the core redux package, and contains API methods and common dependencies that we think are essential for building a Redux app. Redux Toolkit builds in our suggested best practices, simplifies most Redux tasks, prevents common mistakes, and makes it easier to write Redux applications.
